```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(ExtDist)
```

Everything is going to be respresented as a distribution - but in practice everything is displayed discretely so we can just have r show values from continuous density functions at whatever chosen interval

1. C uptake to pyruvate

```{r}
dP = function(C, #carbon pool
              P, #pyruvate pool
              Vu, #max uptake rate
              Ku, #uptake half-sat
              r_r, #remobilization rate from glycogen
              G, #glycogen pool 
              x, #organism length
              res, #model spatial resolution
              r_g, #growth allocation
              r_c, #citric acid allocation
              r_s = (1- (r_g + r_c)), #storage allocation
              beta = 20, alpha = 1 #parameters to constrain spatial distribution
){
  require(ExtDist)
  
  space = seq(0, x, by = res)
  
  dPdt = ((V*Cu)/(C + Ku)) * dBeta_ab(space, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta, a = 0, b = x) + r_r * G - (r_g + r_c +r_s) * G
  
}


```


2. Glycogen

```{r}

dG = function(G, 
              P, 
              r_s, 
              r_r, 
              r_t #tartaric acid production
              ){
  
  dGdt = r_s*P - (r_r + r_t)*G
  
  
}

```


3. Tartaric

```{r}
dZt = function(G, 
               P, 
               Zt, #total tartaric acid pool
               x,
               k_t, #rate constant for acid nutrient binding
               Vm, #acid uptake max
               Km, #acid uptake half-sat
               q, # carbon to nutrient ratio
               r_t, #tartaric acid production
               
){
  
  dZtdt = 
  
}


```
